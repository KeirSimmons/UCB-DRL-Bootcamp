# UCB-DRL-Bootcamp

Note that this is a WIP - not all files have been added, labs are yet incomplete, and the directory structure needs some prettifying. 

TODO: All the above!

This repo will contain all files (labs, lecture slides, etc) provided during the Deep Reinforcement Learning bootcamp held at UC Berkeley on August 26th and 27th, 2017. More information can be found here: deeprlbootcamp.berkeley.edu
